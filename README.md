This repo Contain the extensions and classes which are not included in native DART SDK.
Some of my own implementations that i implement according to the time of need. And Some are from other smart fellows on the Internet. And some of them are available in external library packages but for only one thing i don't feel like  i have to install  whole package just to use only one function OR class. Documentation also provided.
